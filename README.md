Project name: Happy 28th birthday Jeongyeon
About: This is a project I decided to do to celebrate Jeongyeon from TWICE a KPOP group who is also celebrating their 10th anniversary.
I choose GitHub to practice using HTML, CSS, and a little JS.
It is a personal appreciation page to show the world how amazing and talented she is, all from my point of view.
Features: It has a list of points to get to know who is she and what has she done in her career.
I am thinking in adding more features but it will be progressively.
Made by: greenlovejy for Yoo Jeongyeon's birthday - not for commercial use.
